What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	It creates an git repository named .git which is hidden in most of the file explorer.
Before starting to commit, we need this repository to store our verisons as commits.
This repository will be having all the commits regarding the directory and subdirectories of this directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

	From the working directory, you can select what files you want to add to be commited.
Git offers Staging area, in which we can add files one after another which we want to commit,
and from this Staging area, git will make a commit to the repository(meaning, of all files).

change?

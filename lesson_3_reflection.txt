When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  
    I'll want to use remote repository, When collaborating with other people working on same project, or when making the project
    open-source to let other people experimenting or use the project as they want, or if we want to
    host our project on the internet.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    I might want to always pull changes manually because if Git does everything automatically, then everytime
    local resository and GitHub repository will have same commits history which sometimes user would not want. By manually 
    doing it will give the user more flexibility.
